# 🧠 Medical Image Segmentation using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project implements **deep learning-based image segmentation for medical imaging**. The aim is to automate the identification and delineation of anatomical or pathological regions (e.g., tumors, organs) in medical scans such as MRI, CT, or dermoscopy images.

Manual segmentation is **time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent**, especially for complex images. Deep learning models such as **U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and nnU-Net** provide scalable, automated solutions that can significantly improve the **accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnostics**.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Apply **computer vision techniques** to segment medical images.
* Implement **Python-based deep learning models** for segmentation.
* Compare models (e.g., U-Net vs. DeepLabV3).
* Evaluate performance using **Dice coefficient, IoU, Precision, Recall**.
* Provide insights into **advantages, disadvantages, and scalability** of models.

## 🗂 Dataset

* A **freely available dataset** must be used, such as:

  * [ISIC Skin Lesion Dataset](https://www.isic-archive.com/)
  * [TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
  * [Kaggle Lung Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* Preprocessing steps:

  * Resize images (128×128, 256×256).
  * Normalize pixel values.
  * Apply data augmentation (flips, rotations, scaling).
  * Train/validation/test split.

## 🏗 Model Architectures

### 1. U-Net

* Encoder-decoder structure with **skip connections**.
* Efficient for **biomedical segmentation tasks**.

### 2. DeepLabV3+

* Uses **atrous convolutions** and **ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling)**.
* Handles **multi-scale context** better.

### 3. (Optional) nnU-Net

* A **self-configuring framework** that adapts preprocessing, architecture, and training automatically.

## 🚀 Training

Run training with:

```bash
python src/train.py --model unet --epochs 50 --batch-size 8 --lr 0.001
```

Arguments:

* `--model` : Model type (`unet`, `deeplabv3`).
* `--epochs` : Number of training epochs.
* `--batch-size` : Batch size for training.
* `--lr` : Learning rate.

---

## 📊 Evaluation

Evaluate model performance:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model unet --checkpoint outputs/checkpoints/unet_best.pth
```

Metrics reported:
